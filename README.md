# Note to PDF Tool
This tool will generate your .md notes to pdf format. 

To install, run the script
```bash
./install
```

To use the tool, run command
```bash
pdfnote [file1] [file2] [...]
```

When you first install the script, it will ask you to select a destination for the pdf notes to be generated. 
For every notes you've generated, it is also able to search for the history of notes you've generated, and list their absolute path. 
Everytime the note is being generated, you may use the flag -d to specify the directory within the pdfnotes directory for it to be generated.
